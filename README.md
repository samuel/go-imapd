IMAP Server
===========

This is an experimental IMAP server package for Go. It's in no way useable
at the moment, but please feel free to have a look around.

The long term goal is to provide the basics of an IMAP server but have
the message store backend pluggable.

Some possible uses:

- Electronic mail (umm, yeah) aka email
- Bringing back FidoNet
